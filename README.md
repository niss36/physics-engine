# physics-engine

Basic physics simulation (rigid bodies) written in Rust, using the [macroquad framework](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad).

Runs natively on most platforms (tested on Windows and macOS), and in the browser using WebAssembly.

The WASM version can be accessed on [GitHub Pages](https://niss36.github.io/physics-engine/wasm.html).

## Build Instructions

See [macroquad's build instructions](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad#build-instructions).

Make sure to use the `--release` flag for better (5-10x) performance.
